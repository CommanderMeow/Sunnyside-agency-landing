## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS



### What I learned

CSS Grid has always been a bit confusing so I tackled it with this projects. It took several frustrating attemptings to remedy issues I was having but I am proud of the fact I was able to overcome certain obsticles and understand CSS grid better.


### Continued development

I will continue to use more CSS Grid in the future and find better and more effective ways of implimenting it with flex box instead of only ever going with flex.
